# Hyperface-tensorflow2
This is a Tensorflow 2 implementation of the paper HyperFace: A Deep Multi-task Learning Framework for Face Detection, Landmark Localization, Pose Estimation, and Gender Recognition (IEEE TPAMI 2016).
</br>The main idea of the paper is to fuse the intermediate layers of a deep CNN in order to train different tasks under consideration. It presents an architecture to learn common features for these tasks and exploit the synergy among them.
